Text Summarization with NLTK
This project demonstrates a text summarization pipeline using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).
It leverages tokenization, word frequency analysis, and hierarchical summarization techniques to create concise summaries from long text documents.

#Overview
This project enables efficient text summarization using the power of natural language processing with NLTK. It processes long texts, calculates their tokenized lengths, and generates proportional summaries by breaking the text into manageable chunks and summarizing them hierarchically.

The summarization approach includes:

Tokenizing text into words and sentences.
Using word frequency distributions to score sentences.
Selecting sentences based on their frequency scores and token limits.

#Features
Tokenization of words and sentences.
Word frequency-based text summarization.
Stopword removal and punctuation filtering.
Proportional summarization for multiple documents.
Hierarchical summarization for segmenting large texts.

#How It Works
1. Tokenization
The text is divided into words and sentences using NLTK's word_tokenize and sent_tokenize.

2. Word Frequency Analysis
Word frequency is calculated using NLTK's FreqDist.
Stopwords and punctuation are filtered out to retain meaningful words.
3. Sentence Scoring
Each sentence is scored based on the sum of the frequencies of the words it contains.

4. Summarization
Sentences are selected in descending order of scores until the target length is reached.
The TreebankWordDetokenizer reassembles the selected sentences into a coherent summary.
5. Hierarchical Summarization
For very large texts, the summarization is performed in segments, and partial summaries are combined into a final summary.

#Future Improvements
Improve scoring by incorporating semantic analysis or embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or BERT).
Add multi-language support using other NLTK language models.
Handle edge cases such as extremely short or unstructured texts.
Develop a web interface or API for easier access.
